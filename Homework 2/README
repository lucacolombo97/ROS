Description of the file:

amcl.launch: launch file used to localize the robot in the given 2d map
amcl_imu.launch: launch file used to localize the robot in the given 2d map improved through IMUs data
gmapping.launch: launch file used to create the map using gmapping with visual odometry
gmapping_optitrack: launch file used to create the map using gmapping with optitrack odometry
gmapping_imu.launch: launch file used to create the map using gmapping with visual odometry improved through IMUs data

Name of bag used for create the map: 2020-05-14-16-14-37-traj2-os1-t265-pix
Name of bag used for localization: 2020-05-14-16-09-36-traj1-os1-t265-pix

The structure of tf tree is in the files attached:
-amcl: view frames_amcl.pdf
-gmapping: view frames_gmapping.pdf

How start the nodes:
Inside the launch folder type the command "roslaunch gmapping.launch".
To start the others launch files, use the same command with the different name of the launch file.

Other things:
-In the map there are some errors although different parameters are been tested.
-Pointcloud to laserscan has been used to convert a 3d pointcloud into a 2d laserscan.
-To fuse visual odometry with imus data we have used the robot pose ekf.
