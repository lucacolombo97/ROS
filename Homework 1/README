Description of the src files:

pub_sub: convert from lla to ENU and publish TF and Odom for both car and obstacle
custom_msg: publish a custom message with fields: distance between car and obstacle and status flag
compute_distance: the service that returns the distance between the two vehicles 

The parameters for dynamic reconfigure are:
unsafe_param: threshold for classifying safe/unsafe distance (default: 5m)
crash_param: threshold for classifying crash distance (default: 1m)
If: 
- crash_param < dist < unsafe_param -> "Unsafe"
- dist > unsafe_param -> "Safe"
- dist < crash_param -> "Crash"
If the parameters are negative or crash_param > unsafe_param the modification is ignored

The parameters in the launch:
lat_param,long_param,h_param: starting point

The structure of tf tree is in the "view frames.pdf" file attached

Structure of custom_msg:
dist: distance between car and obstacle
flag: status of the car

How start the nodes:
Inside the launch folder, type command "roslaunch project1.launch"

Other things:
-In Pub_sub to choose between car and obstacle is passed a number as input, 0 for the car and 1 for the obstacle
-At the beginning, when obs is not yet started distance is set to -1 so the custom msg is not published
-If there is a nan, custom_msg publish a message with nan for distance and "GPS signal lost" for flag
